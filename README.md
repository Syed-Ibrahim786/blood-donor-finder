  ## **‚ùå Actual Problem**

 

   patients sometime dont get blood in neither from hospital nor banks due to rarity, inavailabilty etc.,
   situation get worse when finding donors since there is no perfect mean or way for that yet.
   besides heartbreak, pressure of finding donors , time is already running.

   BloodNet makes it happen

  - User can select donors after search and give neccesary info i.e., hospital name, contact number, place to alert donor.
  - Donor can see requests from his/her dashboard and make call to confirm.
